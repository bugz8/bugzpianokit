**Project Defination and Goals:**

1) The goal of this project is to create a simple/responsive web application which can play 7 notes (whole octave) on a piano by clicking one button each note.

2) I built this project using html/css/bootstrap/javascript, I created 7 buttons which can make sound, each key has a specific piano note.

3) You can successfully play piano on a simple web application using only your keyboard.
